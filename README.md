# Flashcard Learning App

A simple Flashcard Learning App built using Python and Tkinter that helps users learn French words. The app shows a French word on a card, and after a set period, flips to show its English translation. Users can mark words they know, and these words will be removed from the learning list.

- Users can mark words they know using the "right" button, removing them from future cards.
